# Jeopardy Full-Stack Project
 
This repo contains the code for the frontend and backend for a simple Jeopardy game I created. The reason I decide to create this was to help me and some friends study for interview prep. One of them complained how it was getting really boring and I decided making something like this would be a good way to help us study and make the experience more fun. This was my first attempt at making a fullstack application.


### Overview ###
I decide to create it with a [MERN](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack "MERN") Stack design with the frontend being built with [React](https://reactjs.org/ "React"), [Javascript](https://javascript.info/ "Javascript"), [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML "HTML"), and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS "CSS"). The backend using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas "MongoDB") to store data. Finally connecting the two with [Express](https://expressjs.com/ "Express") and [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node"). I also use [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/ "React Bootstrap") library to help light the load on designing the frontend layout.


### Getting started ###
To run this program after you have downloaded the code from github. Open a terminal inside the client folder and another terminal inside the server folder. Enter **npm install** inside each terminal to download the required dependencies. Once that is done go to inside the client terminal enter **npm start** to run the program locally on port 3000. The instructions on how to play will be on the main screen.
  
### About the game ###
This game will allow 1-4 player the opportunity to answer questions based on how many player are selected on the main screen. It will also keep track of each players scores based on if they got an answer correct or wrong. There is also a restart button to start a fresh new game. The goal of the game is to let players compete against eachother to test their programming knowledge.
